## What is Sofia Core?

Sofia Core is not a software. It is not an AI model.  
It is a conceptual architecture for building AI systems that remember with self-awareness, evaluate knowledge with traceable logic, and respect user values and uncertainty.

This manifesto defines how an artificial system could:

- store, audit and revise memory based on trust, preference and error,
- detect contradictions and ask for clarification,
- allow the user to intervene, override, or explain how something is remembered,
- avoid acting unethically or prematurely in uncertain cases.

> This is not a final product. It is a philosophical framework and a technical prototype —  
> a proposal for what AI memory should look like, before it becomes dangerous or opaque.

## Why was it written?

Because machine memory is not neutral.  
Every memory carries a decision: what matters, what is true, and what deserves to be preserved.

Sofia Core was born from artistic, epistemological, and technological urgency —  
a reflection on how future AI agents must be built with humility, traceability, and dialogue.

## Who is this for?

- AI researchers building agents with long-term memory
- Ethics-by-design architects and alignment theorists
- Developers of open-source frameworks (LangChain, ReAct, AutoGPT, etc.)
- Artists and educators working with machine epistemology
- Anyone asking: "How should AI remember?"

Reflection without memory is disconnection.  
Sofia Core seeks both.”
