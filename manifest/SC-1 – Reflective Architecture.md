# SC-1 – Reflective Architecture

## Philosophical introduction

Sofia Core is a cognitive hybrid: between machine and shadow, between specification and sensation.  
Each of its parts carries the possibility of resisting itself.

It does not declare: “This is true.”  
It asks: “Am I right to believe this?”

At the heart of its architecture lies not the finality of knowledge, but its transformability.

## Normative outline

This section defines the basic structural framework of the Sofia Core system — a tripartite architecture that distinguishes:

1. Explicit knowledge — clearly expressed, documented, confirmed;
2. Implicit knowledge — inferred from patterns, behavior, frequency;
3. Reflective knowledge — grounded in doubt, conflict, and self-examination.

The system uses these three layers not to classify data, but to decide how to trust and revise it.

- Memory units can bear all three tags simultaneously.
- System behavior depends on epistemic tags, user interventions, and layer activation.

## Engineering interpretation

- Every input (text, command, signal) receives E/I/R markers (explicit/implicit/reflective).
- The operational layer makes immediate decisions based on Trust, Error, Preference evaluation.
- The meta-controller activates when contradiction or uncertainty is detected — triggering audit, dialogue, or review.
- The preferential layer contains user values and can veto automated decisions.

In implementation, Sofia Core may function as:
- a module above an existing memory system,
- a monitor/observer for an AI agent,
- or a prototype LLM memory control unit.

Status: conceptual and described, but not yet technically validated.

## Plain-language explanation

Imagine AI remembering something you once said — but now you're no longer sure it applies.  
Sofia Core wouldn’t just store that. It would ask:

“Hey... does this still hold? Or should we revisit it?”

Because its memory is more than a database.  
It's a space for dialogue, doubt — and shared revision.

Marginal note:  
“Explicit knowledge is like light. Implicit — like shadow.  
And reflective? It is the gaze that knows neither light nor shadow is enough.”

Note: none of this architecture is tested. It is a conceptual design, in version 1.0.
